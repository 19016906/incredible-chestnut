**Changes in immigration laws**

**Data hacking**

**Reliance on partners and third parties**

**Financial loss**

**High competition in market**

**Physical risks**

**1. Changes in immigration laws:** It is biggest risk in immigration industry because all work is depends on the immigration rules and regulations. I will affect the business badly. For examples, many countries provide a study permit for higher studies. If immigration laws are changed related to this program than it will automatically affect the business.

**Solution**: In the solution of that, we should be aware about the each and every change in immigration laws. Secondly, if one program is closed in immigration laws, there is always another new program and another option in same categories.

**2. Technical issues:** As, in my venture there is no paper work, there is only computer related work. So, there will be lot technical risks such as data hacking, information lost, network problems, busy websites and many more. These are explained following:

Ø **Data Hacking:** All information of clients is stored online and offline as per requirement. In this technical era, there is a biggest problem in data lost that is hacking. Hackers can hack our various accounts on various websites such as email account, other agent website accounts. They can delete important files and mails related client’s information.

Ø **Networking problem**: There will be some network issues such as busy websites and internet speed and so on. It will damage data and slow down the whole work speed.

Ø **Data and information loss**: Important files related to information of clients such as personal information and documents will be deleted by mistakes and crashed by any virus in system.

**Solution**: All problem related to hacking is solved by increasing the security such as a strong passwords, security questions and other privacy options. We can upgrade the systems with the strong and better anti-virus for prevent the virus. Another way to prevent the data lost is that we can store data at more than one place.

**3. Reliance on partners and third parties:** Third parties involvement is important to boost up your business but it will affect your business if they take step back. As immigration business is international business and depends on the other countries immigration laws. So, there is reliance on third parties such as tie ups with other agents and companies. For example, in study visa, there is a tie ups with colleges and universities and in work permits there is a tie ups with the working industries such as factories and construction agencies. If they take step back in business than business will lost very badly.

**Solution**: In the solution of that, we can give attractive offers to third parties and partners as compare to our competitors which will convince them to don’t take step back in business. Secondly, always keep back up regarding these lose such as other partners and other third parties such as other colleges and universities in study visa and other companies in work visa.

4\. **Financial loss**: As there is a competition in each and every field, so there is a lot of difficulties can be faced by new investors in every business industry. In my venture, there will be also lot of difficulties to set up my business and keeping it at the top in immigration industries. Difficulties such as fewer clients, less profit leads to the financial loss.

**Solution:** To prevent this risk, we have to increase our income by increasing our clients. For increasing our clients, we can give attractive and better offers to our clients such as special discounts and many other offers.

5\. **High competition in market:** In this competitive era, there is a competition in each and every filed. In my venture, there are also lots of competitors which are already on the top of immigration industry and I have to compete them in business which is very hard. It also leads to financial risk. This competition also affects the clients, if other companies give better offers to them.

**Solution**: In the solution of that, we can win the competition by increasing clients and clients will increase only when we win the hearts of people. Winning hearts of people keep any business at the top of industry. For increasing the clients, we can give a better and correct information regarding their cases and give them better offers such as discounts and many more.

**6. Physical risks:** At Each and every place, there will be some physical risks such as fire and natural disasters (floods and earth quick) which can damage the office property and it leads to the financial loss.

Solution: To prevent the physical risks, we can improve the building infrastructure such as use better material while set up the building for office and set up fire alarms.
